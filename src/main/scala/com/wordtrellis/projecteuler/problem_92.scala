/**
  * Problem 92
  * A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in
  * a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.
  *
  * For example,
  *
  * 44 ->  32  ->  13  ->  10  ->  1  ->  1
  * 85  ->  89  ->  145  ->  42  ->  20  ->  4  ->  16  ->  37  ->  58  ->  89
  *
  * Therefore any chain that arrives at 1 or 89 will become stuck in an endless
  * loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually
  * arrive at 1 or 89.
  *
  * How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at 89?
