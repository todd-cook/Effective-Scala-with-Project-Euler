/**
  * Problem 31
  *
  * In England the currency is made up of pound, &pound;, and pence, p, and
  * there are eight coins in general circulation:
  *
  * 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, 1 pound (100p) and 2 pound (200p).
  *
  * It is possible to make 2 pound in the following way:
  *
  * 1 pound 1 + 1 50p + 2 20p + 1 5p + 1 2p + 3 1p
  *
  * How many different ways can 2 pound be made using any number of coins?

  * Commentary:
  * Generating combinations is very expensive
  * to solve problem 31 in worst case:
  * 34825 * 8 Bytes (64 bit ints) * 200 == circa 44 megs
  * Although reusable, this solution need excessive memory to generate all the combinations
  * -Xmx98M
  *
  * Examine the utility classes: CoinCollection, CoinConstraints, CoinCombination
  *
  *
  * Results:
  *
  * possible combinations: 1 for coins up to: 1
  * possible combinations: 101 for coins up to: 2
  * possible combinations: 1091 for coins up to: 5
