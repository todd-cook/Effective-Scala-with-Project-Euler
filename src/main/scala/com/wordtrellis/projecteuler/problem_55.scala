/**
  * Problem 55
  *
  * If we take 47, reverse and add, 47 + 74 = 121, which is palindromic.
  *
  * Not all numbers produce palindromes so quickly. For example,
  *
  * 349 + 943 = 1292,
  * 1292 + 2921 = 4213
  * 4213 + 3124 = 7337
  *
  * That is, 349 took three iterations to arrive at a palindrome.
  *
  * Although no one has proved it yet, it is thought that some numbers, like 196,
  * never produce a palindrome. A number that never forms a palindrome through
  * the reverse and add process is called a Lychrel number. Due to the
  * theoretical nature of these numbers, and for the purpose of this problem,
  * we shall assume that a number is Lychrel until proven otherwise. In addition
  * you are given that for every number below ten-thousand, it will either (i)
  * become a palindrome in less than fifty iterations, or, (ii) no one, with
  * all the computing power that exists, has managed so far to map it to a
  * palindrome. In fact, 10677 is the first number to be shown to require
  * over fifty iterations before producing
  * a palindrome: 4668731596684224866951378664 (53 iterations, 28-digits).
  *
  * Surprisingly, there are palindromic numbers that are themselves Lychrel
  * numbers; the first example is 4994.
  *
  * How many Lychrel numbers are there below ten-thousand?

/**
  *
  * Commentary
  * notes from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lychrel_numbers
  * The reverse and add process produces the sum of a number and the number
  * formed by reversing the order of its digits. e.g.
  * 56 + 65 = 121, 125 + 521 = 646.
  *
  * Some numbers become palindromes quickly after repeated reversal and
  * addition, and are therefore not Lychrel numbers. All 1 digit and 2
  * digit numbers eventually become palindromes after repeated reversal
  * and addition. About 80% of all numbers under 10,000 resolve into a
  * palindrome in 4 or fewer steps. About 90% solve in 7 steps or less.
  * Here are a few examples of non-Lychrel numbers:
  *
  * 56 becomes palindromic after one iteration: 56+65 = 121.
  * 57 becomes palindromic after two iterations: 57+75 = 132, 132+231 = 363.
  * 59 is not a Lychrel number since it becomes a palindrome after
  * 3 iterations: 59+95 = 154, 154+451 = 605, 605+506 = 1111
  * 89 takes an unusually large 24 iterations (the most of any number
  * under 10,000 that is known to resolve into a palindrome)
  * to reach the palindrome 8813200023188.
