  /**
    * So the Stream of prime factors stars out with 2 in order to give a starting place for
    * looking for factors. The while loop then iterates through Longs starting with the last
    * value in primes. Once a factor is found, that factor is divided out of limit and the
    * new factor (tmp) is returned by the anonymous function as the next Long in primes.
    * This continues until all the prime factors of limit are found, at which point limit is
    * 1 and the loop just keeps returning the highest factor that was found.
    * The next line forces the lazy evaluation for the first 10 factors of primes, and then prints
    * the last factor, which gives us the answer. 10 was just an arbitrary number large enough
    * to get the factor we were looking for. A more general solution would take from primes until
    * it got two sequential elements that were the same, and then print that one.
