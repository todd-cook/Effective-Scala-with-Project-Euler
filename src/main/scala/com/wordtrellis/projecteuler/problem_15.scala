/**
 * Problem 15
 * Starting in the top left corner of a 2 * 2 grid, there are 6 routes (without backtracking)
 * to the bottom right corner.
 * How many routes are there through a 20 * 20 grid?
 *
 * o - o - o
 * |   |   |
 * o - o - o
 * |   |   |
 * o - o - o
 *
 * Commentary:
 *  Frequently Project Euler problems give you just enough information to perform the algorithm,
 *  but not enough sample data to deduce the shortcut.
 *  Diagram out the possibilities for the 6 solutions, then do so for 4 point graph, yielding 20
 *  variations. A four point grid yields 2 paths to the required destination. The numbers form
 *  a predictable sequence, the central binomial coefficient.
