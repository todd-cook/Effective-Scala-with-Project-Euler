/**
  * Problem 56
  *
  * A googol (10^(100)) is a massive number: one followed by one-hundred zeros;
  * 100^(100) is almost unimaginably large: one followed by two-hundred zeros.
  * Despite their size, the sum of the digits in each number is only 1.
  *
  * Considering natural numbers of the form, a^(b), where a, b < 100,
  * what is the maximum digital sum?
