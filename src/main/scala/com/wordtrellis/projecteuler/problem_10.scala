/**
 *  Problem 10
 *  The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.
 *  Find the sum of all the primes below two million.
 *
 *  Solution:
 *  Sieve of Eratosthenes
 *  see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_eratosthenes
 *  1. Create a list of consecutive integers from two to n: (2, 3, 4, ..., n).
 *  2. Initially, let p equal 2, the first prime number.
 *   3. Strike from the list all multiples of p less than or equal to n.
 *   4. Find the first number remaining on the list greater than p
 *   (this number is the next prime); replace p with this number.
 *   5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until p2 is greater than n.
 *   6. All the remaining numbers on the list are prime.
 *
 *  Or a better more modern version is the Sieve of SieveOfAtkin
 *  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Atkin
 *
 * First couple attempts are included, see problem_10Fails.scala
