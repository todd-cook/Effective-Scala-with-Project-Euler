/**
 * Problem 30
 *
 * Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers
 * of their digits:
 *
 *  1634 = 1^(4) + 6^(4) + 3^(4) + 4^(4)
 *  8208 = 8^(4) + 2^(4) + 0^(4) + 8^(4)
 *  9474 = 9^(4) + 4^(4) + 7^(4) + 4^(4)
 *
 *  As 1 = 1^(4) is not a sum it is not included.
 *
 *  The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.
 *
 *  Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.
