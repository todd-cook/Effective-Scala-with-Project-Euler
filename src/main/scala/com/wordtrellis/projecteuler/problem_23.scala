/**
 *  Problem 23
 *  A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is
 *  exactly equal to the number.
 *  For example, the sum of the proper divisors of 28 would be
 *  1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28 is a perfect number.
 *
 *  A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less
 *  than n and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds n.
 *
 *  As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the smallest
 *  number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is 24. By
 *  mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater than
 *  28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However, this
 *  upper limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis even though it is
 *  known that the greatest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of
 *  two abundant numbers is less than this limit.
 *
 *  Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the
 *  sum of two abundant numbers.
