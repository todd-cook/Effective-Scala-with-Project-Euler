/**
 * Problem 25
 * The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
 *
 *     F_(n) = F_(n - 1) + F_(n - 2), where F_(1) = 1 and F_(2) = 1.
 *
 * Hence the first 12 terms will be:
 *
 *     F_(1) = 1
 *     F_(2) = 1
 *     F_(3) = 2
 *     F_(4) = 3
 *     F_(5) = 5
 *     F_(6) = 8
 *     F_(7) = 13
 *     F_(8) = 21
 *     F_(9) = 34
 *     F_(10) = 55
 *     F_(11) = 89
 *     F_(12) = 144
 *
 *  The 12th term, F_(12), is the first term to contain three digits.
 *
 *  What is the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?
