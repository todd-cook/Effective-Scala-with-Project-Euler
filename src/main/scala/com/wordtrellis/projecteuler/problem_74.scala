/**
  * Problem 74
  * The number 145 is well known for the property that the sum of the factorial
  * of its digits is equal to 145:
  *
  * 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145
  *
  * Perhaps less well known is 169, in that it produces the longest chain of
  * numbers that link back to 169; it turns out that there are only three such
  * loops that exist:
  *
  * 169 ->  363601  ->  1454  ->  169
  * 871  ->  45361  ->  871
  * 872  ->  45362  ->  872
  *
  * It is not difficult to prove that EVERY starting number will eventually get
  * stuck in a loop. For example,
  *
  * 69  ->  363600  ->  1454  ->  169  ->  363601 ( ->  1454)
  * 78  ->  45360  ->  871  ->  45361 ( ->  871)
  * 540  ->  145 ( ->  145)
  *
  * Starting with 69 produces a chain of five non-repeating terms, but the
  * longest non-repeating chain with a starting number below one million is
  * sixty terms.
  *
  * How many chains, with a starting number below one million, contain exactly
  * sixty non-repeating terms?
