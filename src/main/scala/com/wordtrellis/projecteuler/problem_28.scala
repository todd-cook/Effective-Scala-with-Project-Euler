/**
  * Problem 28
  *
  * Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction
  * a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:
  *
  *  21 22 23 24 25
  *  20  7  8  9 10
  *  19  6  1  2 11
  *  18  5  4  3 12
  *  17 16 15 14 13
  *
  * It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.
  *
  * What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral
  * formed in the same way?
