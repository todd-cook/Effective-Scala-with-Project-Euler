/**
 * Problem 28
 *
 * Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction
 * a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:
 *
 *  21 22 23 24 25
 *  20  7  8  9 10
 *  19  6  1  2 11
 *  18  5  4  3 12
 *  17 16 15 14 13
 *
 * It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.
 *
 * What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral
 * formed in the same way?
