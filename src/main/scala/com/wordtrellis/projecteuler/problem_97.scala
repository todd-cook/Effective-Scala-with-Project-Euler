/**
  *  Problem 97
  *
  *  The first known prime found to exceed one million digits was discovered in 1999, and is a
  *  Mersenne prime of the form 26972593−1; it contains exactly 2,098,960 digits. Subsequently
  *  other Mersenne primes, of the form 2p−1, have been found which contain more digits.
  *
  *  However, in 2004 there was found a massive non-Mersenne prime which contains 2,357,207 digits:
  *  28433 * 2^7830457 + 1
  *
  *  Find the last ten digits of this prime number.
