/**
 * Problem 38
 * Take the number 192 and multiply it by each of 1, 2, and 3:
 *  192 * 1 = 192
 *  192 * 2 = 384
 *  192 * 3 = 576
 *
 *  By concatenating each product we get the 1 to 9 pandigital, 192384576.
 *  We will call 192384576 the concatenated product of 192 and (1,2,3)
 *
 *  The same can be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying by 1, 2, 3, 4,
 *  and 5, giving the pandigital, 918273645, which is the concatenated product
 *  of 9 and (1,2,3,4,5).
 *  What is the largest 1 to 9 pandigital 9-digit number that can be formed as
 *  the concatenated product of an integer with (1,2, ... , n) where n > 1?
